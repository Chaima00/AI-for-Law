This project uses free and open-source AI models to analyze legal contracts.  
It extracts, summarizes, and answers questions about PDF contracts â€” with **zero OpenAI API keys** required.

## Features

- Extracts raw text from legal PDF contracts
- Summarizes long contracts using `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
- Answers legal questions using `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`
- Uses LegalBERT for future clause classification or embedding analysis
- 100% runs locally in Jupyter Notebook, with no paid APIs
